I recently completed an in-depth analysis of Andhra Pradesh's health insurance data using Python to uncover actionable insights aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and financial efficiency across districts, hospitals, and patient demographics.

Key Steps Undertaken:
🔍 Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Identified and addressed missing values in key fields like PREAUTH_AMT and CLAIM_AMOUNT.
Standardized categories such as HOSP_TYPE and SRC_REGISTRATION for consistency.
Converted date columns (PREAUTH_DATE, CLAIM_DATE, etc.) to datetime format for accurate time-based analysis.

📊 Data Analysis:

Demographic analysis to understand the distribution of claims by age and gender.
Financial comparisons between preauthorized and claimed amounts across hospital types.
Geographic analysis to identify districts with the highest claim amounts.
Annual trend analysis of claim amounts to observe patterns over time.

📈 Data Visualization:
Developed bar charts to represent hospital type registrations and district-wise claims.
Created line charts to showcase the increasing trend of claim amounts per year.
Used pie charts to visualize gender distribution of claim amounts and hospital type contributions.

Insights Uncovered:
📍 Demographic Trends:

Age Group: Patients aged 41–60 years submitted the highest claim amounts.
Gender: Male patients accounted for 57% of the total claim amounts.

📍 Geographic Insights:

District Trends: Guntur had the highest claim amount (11.80%), followed by East Godavari (10.92%).
Registrations: District hospital registrations dominated in the SRC_REGISTRATION category.

📍 Outcome Analysis:

Claim Trends: Claim amounts have been increasing annually, as represented by a line chart.
Mortality Analysis: SRC registration type did not affect mortality rates.

📍 Medical and Financial Insights:

Claimed Amounts: In corporate hospitals, 79.77% of the claims amounts, compared to 20.22% in government hospitals.

Recommendations:
To optimize healthcare outcomes and financial operations:

⿡ Enhance Preauthorization Accuracy: Implement better estimation processes to reduce discrepancies between preauthorized and actual claim amounts.
⿢ Target High-Claim Districts: Allocate additional resources and healthcare infrastructure to districts like Guntur and East Godavari.
⿣ Focus on Age-Specific Policies: Develop targeted healthcare policies for patients aged 41–60 years, as they constitute the majority of high claim amounts.
⿤ Gender-Specific Programs: Address male-dominated claim trends by focusing on health awareness and preventive measures for men.                                                                                                                                                                                 
This project highlights the power of data-driven insights to support decision-making, refine healthcare strategies, and enhance patient outcomes across Andhra Pradesh. 💡
